      "When in the Course of human events, it becomes necessary for one people to dissolve thepolitical bands which have connected them with another, and to assume among the powers of theearth, the separate and equal station to which the Laws of Nature and of Nature's God entitlethem, a decent respect to the opinions of mankind requires that they should declare the causeswhich impel them to the separation. We hold these truths to be self-evident, that all men are created equal, that they are endowed bytheir Creator with certain unalienable Rights, that among these are Life, Liberty and the pursuit\n",
      "of Happiness.— \u0014That to secure these rights, Governments are instituted among Men, derivingtheir just powers from the consent of the governed,—  \u0014That whenever any Form of Government\n",
